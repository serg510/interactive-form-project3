# interactive-form-project3
Building a interactive form using JQUERY.

In this project, you'll use JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional conference called "FullStack Conf."

Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, you'll add your own JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:

adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
